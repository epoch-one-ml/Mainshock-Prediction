# Mainshock-Prediction
In recent months, Bangladesh has experienced a surge in seismic activity, culminating in a 5.7-magnitude earthquake near Narsingdi and Ghorashal that caused multiple fatalities, widespread structural damage, and public panic. For a developing country like Bangladesh, where infrastructure is comparatively weaker and urban density is extremely high, distinguishing whether an initial quake is a mainshock or a foreshock is critically important for emergency response and public safety. However, identifying these classifications before the seismic sequence unfolds is not possible through traditional seismological methods. This uncertainty leaves the population vulnerable, as a seemingly moderate tremor could precede a far more destructive mainshock. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore data-driven approaches that can analyze historical seismic patterns and estimate the likelihood that an early event in a sequence may correspond to a mainshock. By leveraging machine learning models trained on decades of global earthquake data, this research aims to provide an alternative predictive framework that could support early decision-making and improve national earthquake preparedness.
